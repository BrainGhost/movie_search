# **Filamu_show**

> This application uses The MovieDB API to display some popular shows, the app is intended to showcase my React js skills in getting data from the API using Axios and mapping it into components, as well as constructing a search bar for users to search across movies, The app is still in its early stages. I intend to continue adding features. i intend to continue adding feature.
The app was inspired by Dev Ed, a brilliant youtuber and developer; I was able to add some of my own features, and I am planning to keep adding more features.

### Technologies
Here are some of the technology used:
- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/ "React JS")
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro "Axios") (to fetch data from the API)

_ intergrate Axios to fetch the data instead of the FETCH methods
